# Rendezvous With Ramegeddon #

This project takes inspiration from Arthur C. Clarke's classic novel "Rendezvous with Rama." The goal being to create a model of Rama's passage through the inner solar system as if it were on a hazardous trajectory with Earth. Considerations were taken in for the planets respective mass, semi-major axis in relation to the Sun, eccentricity, inclination etc. Visual Python was used to create animations of the scenario. Two key resources that helped make this possible were:
>"Calculating Keplerian Elements.pdf" provided by JPL. It can be found under the `resources` directory.

> ["Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students" by Howard Curtis](http://store.elsevier.com/Orbital-Mechanics/Howard-Curtis/isbn-9780080470542/)
