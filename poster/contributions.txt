All authors discussed the approach and organization of the project. 
The workload in all parts of the development and problem solving of 
this project were dispersed equally amongst the team. Ashley Mascareno 
and jbboyd were responsible for obtaining the documents where Keplerian 
elements for planetary bodies were sourced from. All authors contributed
to the Github repository, wiki, and issues pages. andywinhold was 
responsible for getting the coordinates of planetary bodies into 
heliocentric coordinates oriented with respect to ecliptic plane. 
jbboyd developed the gravity and dynamics functions that propagate 
the solar system forward in time. All authors worked to get the hyperbolic
trajectory of Rama and to confirm its potential threat to Earth. 
jbboyd created with andywinhold editing the 2D, 3D, and energy matplotlib plots. 
jbboyd developed the code for 3D animation of the scenario in VPython. 
Ashley Mascareno created the design and layout of information for the team poster.
